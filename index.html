<h2>Stay Empty when?</h2>
<p>When interacting with or thinking about other people.</p>

<h2>Stay Empty of what?</h2>

<p>
	Judgement. And so also it's children, criticism and blame. Any form of judgement allows internal biases to control your thoughts and responses. Criticism breaks down instead of builds. Blame creates distance and clouds the mind.
</p>

<p>
	People are the sum of their genes and life experiences. Their free will exists only in the context of these two things and neither of them were self-chosen. If you accept this then you will see that judgement of them is illogical.
</p> 
<p>
	Removing judgement opens the path to learning, knowledge and ultimately; wisdom.
</p>

<h2>Stay Empty how?</h2>


<p>
	Before engaging visualise your mind as a full glass, then tip it over and empty it out so that only the container remains. The goal is to release all negative emotion and preconceptions and allow your mind to enter a peaceful state.
</p>
<p>
	Be mindful of judgemental thoughts and critically analyse any that arise.
