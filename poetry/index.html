<h2>Poetry about staying empty...</h2>
<p>
<div class="poetry">
“We join spokes together in a wheel, <br>
but it is the emptiness of the center hole <br>
that makes the wagon move. <br>
<br>
We shape clay into a pot, <br>
but it is the emptiness inside <br>
that holds whatever we want. <br>
<br>
We hammer wood for a house, <br>
but it is the inner space <br>
that makes it livable. <br>
<br>
We work with being, <br>
but non-being is what we use.” <br>
<br>
~ Lao Tzu</center>
