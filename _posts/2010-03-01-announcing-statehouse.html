<p>
    Lawrence, Kansas, March 1st 2010â€“This past Friday Domain51, LLC and Kansas
    Grassroots Consulting, LLC jointly released a new iPhone application,
    Statehouse (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/statehouse/id358597696?mt=8#">iTunes Preview</a>), targeted at lobbyists and citizens interested in keeping up
    with the government happenings in Topeka.
</p>

<p>
    The number of bills and committees involved in Kansas Legislature can be
    daunting to even the trained specialist.  Making this information more readily
    accessible to those who need it is the goal of Statehouse.  
</p>

<p>
    "The [Kansas] Government has made all of the information available, but it's
    not accessible," says Travis Swicegood, owner of Domain51. "Trying to navigate
    kslegislature.org on an iPhone is brutal."  Kansas Grassroots and Domain51
    think that this app fills some of the accessibility gaps in that website.
</p>

<p>
    The app provides quick links to the daily calendars, agendas, and status
    updates for both chambers of the legislature.  Searchable contact information
    for all current Representatives and Senators is available for offline use.
    Users can also see the current journal, schedule, and view the rules
    online.
</p>

<p>
    This is Domain51's first iPhone application and the second joint venture
    between Domain51 and Kansas Grassroots Consulting.  Earlier this year, they
    collaborated on the successful "Voices" program used as part of the Clean Air
    Kansas campaign.
