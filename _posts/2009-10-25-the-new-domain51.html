<p>
    Welcome to the <a href="http://domain51.com">Domain51.com</a>.  I've
    revamped the site to bring it up-to-date with what we're working on.  I've
    also migrated the site over to <a
    href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a> (<a
    href="http://github.com/tswicegood/jekyll">my fork</a>), which I highly
    recommend for basic sites.
</p>

<p>
    There's a lot more that I plan to add (including comments to these
    blog posts), but those aren't necessary to get this out the door.
    So this qualifies as the release-early, release-often.  Watch for more
    changes.
