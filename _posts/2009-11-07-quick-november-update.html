    I just added the ability to get <a
    href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom</a> support to the blog here
    at <a href="http://domain51.com/">Domain51</a>.  Be sure to add the feed to
    your feed reader.  Adding support was really simple; <a
    href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a> already had
    the heavy lifting done in <a
    href="http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com/">his blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Also new this month is <a href="http://unbearablecomics.com/">Chris
    Dickinson</a>.  Chris started two weeks ago.  He keeps coming back every
    day so I don't think I've scared him off (yet).  Chris has a very diverse
    background&mdash;his degree is in Asian studies, with brief stints in <abbr
    title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> and graphic arts.  I'm really glad to
    have him on board.
</p>

<p>
    We've had a really productive few weeks and have some big launches planned
    for November.  Be sure to <a href="http://domain51.com/atom/">subscribe to
    the feed</a> to see the announcements when these new sites launch.
