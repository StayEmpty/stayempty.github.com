title: About Domain51 and Hacking a Better World
---

<h2>A bit of history</h2>

<p>
    Domain51 started in the spring of 1999 in El Paso, Texas.  <a
    href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/">Travis</a> started work on building
    out his first website for a client, and during the summer of that year
    decided he wanted to stick with it.
</p>

<p>
    Since that time, Travis has focused on building quality programs.  He's
    honed his skills on numerous open-source projects, contributing ideas and
    code to projects in <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a>, <a
    href="http://python.org">Python</a>, and <a
    href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, always trying to stay abreast of all
    of the technologies that affect the web.
</p>

<p>
    After consulting for 5 years, Travis decided to join the &quot;real&quot;
    world and go to work for others.  After stints at several open-source
    startups and a large social networking site, Travis decided he needed
    to strike out on his own and work on projects that made the world a
    better place.
</p>

<p>
    Now, based in downtown Lawrence, Kansas, Domain51 has reopened with
    a focus on web application for non-profits and activism.  That's what the
    slogan means.  We're not in the trenches, but we're supplying ammo to those
    who are getting their hands dirty.  We're <em>hacking a better world</em>.
</p>

<h2>Why we do it</h2>

<p>
    We're passionate about excellent code.  We're passionate about making
    the world a better place.  We're passionate about everything we do.
</p>

<p>
    We're the guys who already do this free.  We contribute to open source, we
    spend our weekends knocking out code for ourselves, we learn new languages
    for nothing more than the challenge.  We're excited about programming because
    that's our passion.  That we get paid to do is what makes this a great gig.

<h2>The deal with the name</h2>

<p>
    From <a href="http://travisswicegood.com/">Travis</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    I get asked this every time I hand out a card.  &quot;What's the deal with
    the name <em>Domain51</em>?&quot;  It's simple.  I was looking for a unique
    name, and had probably just watched something on the History Channel or
    Discover talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51">Area
    51</a>.  I put two and two together and ended up with <a
    href="http://domain51.com/">Domain51</a> and the name stuck.
