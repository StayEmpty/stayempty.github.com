title: About Domain51 and Hacking a Better World
---

<h2>A bit of history</h2>

<p>
    Domain51 was started in the spring of 1999 in El Paso, Texas, by <a
    href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/">Travis Swicegood</a> who started
    working on his first website for a client.  The company remained small
    and focused mostly on tools to help administer websites for the next 5
    years.
</p>

<p>
    After stints at several open-source startups and a large social networking
    site, Travis decided he needed to strike out on his own and work on
    projects that made the world a better place, thus <a
    href="http://domain51.com/">Domain51</a> was reborn.
</p>

<p>
    Now, based in downtown Lawrence, Kansas, Domain51 has reopened with a focus
    on web applications for non-profits and activists.  That's what the slogan
    means.  We're not in the trenches, but we're supplying ammo to those who
    are getting their hands dirty.  We're <em>hacking a better world</em>.
</p>

<h2>Why we do it</h2>

<p>
    We're passionate about excellent code.  We're passionate about making
    the world a better place.  We're passionate about everything we do.
</p>

<p>
    We're the guys who already do this for free.  We contribute to open source,
    we spend our weekends knocking out code for ourselves, we learn new
    languages for nothing more than the challenge.  We're excited about
    programming because that's our passion.  That we get paid to do it is what
    makes this a great gig.

                Travis is the founder of Domain51, and a serial geek.  He's a
                polyglot, with a functional knowledge of Ruby, Python, Erlang,
                Clojure, and Java and is considered an expert in PHP.  He's the
                author of <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/">Pragmatic
                Version Control using Git</a> and a regular speaker at tech
                conferences.
            </p>

            <p>
                His background is in <abbr title="test driven
                development">TDD</abbr> and automation.  His passion is in numbers
                and trying to disect what they mean in the context of the current
                application: be that how quickly someone makes a donation to a
                cause or how efficiently (or in-efficiently) people use a given
                application.

    <h2>The deal with the name</h2>

    <p>
        From <a href="http://travisswicegood.com/">Travis</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        I get asked this every time I hand out a card.  &quot;What's the deal with
        the name <em>Domain51</em>?&quot;  It's simple.  I was looking for a unique
        name, and had probably just watched something on the History Channel or
        Discover talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51">Area
        51</a>.  I put two and two together and ended up with <a
        href="http://domain51.com/">Domain51</a> and the name stuck.
